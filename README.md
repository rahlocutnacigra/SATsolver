# SATsolver

To run the program in the terminal, use `python SAT_solver.py input.txt output.txt`, where the input file contains the SAT problem in the DIMACS format and the output file is the file in which the result should be saved.

To make new test cases, to solve them and to represent results graphicaly use `test2.py`, where you can set new test cases or just run it to solve existing problems.
